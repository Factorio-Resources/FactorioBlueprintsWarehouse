## Introduction
This is an online blueprint repository for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), used for storing and sharing blueprints.  
> The inspiration for this came from the [Dyson Sphere Program Blueprint Repository](https://github.com/DSPBluePrints/FactoryBluePrints/). If you are playing Dyson Sphere Program, feel free to check it out.  
> The tool for packaging blueprint books comes from [FactorioBluePrintToolkit](https://github.com/Factorio-Resources/FactorioBluePrintToolkit/)  

If you want to submit a blueprint, please read the [Submission Guidelines](#submitting-to-the-blueprint-repository).

## How to Use the Blueprint Repository
> If you wish to submit a blueprint, please read the [Submission Guidelines](#submitting-to-the-blueprint-repository).

### Downloading
> Git and update scripts are already integrated, compressing the blueprint software, so there's no need for additional software installation.

1. Open the blueprint repository on your computer using GitHub: [https://github.com/Factorio-Resources/FactorioBlueprintsWarehouse/](https://github.com/Factorio-Resources/FactorioBlueprintsWarehouse/).
2. Click on [Release](https://github.com/Factorio-Resources/FactorioBlueprintsWarehouse/releases/latest) to download the compressed package of the blueprint repository.
3. Place the downloaded compressed package in a location of your choice (not recommended on the C drive) and extract its contents.

### Usage
1. Double-click on the `update.bat` file in the extracted folder and wait for some time.  
2. If no errors occur, the program will add the packaged blueprint book to your clipboard (you can also find it in the blueprint repository folder named \packagedBlueprintBook.txt).  
3. Click on "Import Blueprint" in the bottom right corner of the game and paste the blueprint book code.    
4. Organize the blueprint books from the repository as desired, and you can then delete the previous version of the blueprint repository.

## Submitting to the Blueprint Repository

### Submitting via QQ Group
You can submit your blueprints/blueprint strings to us through these QQ groups:  
> Make sure the text file name of the uploaded string matches your blueprint. Otherwise, the blueprint name will be based on your file name after it is packaged into a blueprint book.

### Submitting via GitHub
> **Requires basic knowledge of GitHub and Git**  

1. Create a fork.  
2. Clone your blueprint repository.  
3. Make changes to the blueprints.
> Ensure that any added blueprints are in folder+blueprint format, rather than blueprint books. You can use [FactorioBluePrintToolkit](https://github.com/Factorio-Resources/FactorioBluePrintToolkit/) to convert blueprint books into folders+blueprints.  
> The names of the folders/blueprints should match the actual names, as the final packaged blueprint book uses the file name as the blueprint name. If you encounter issues with inputting certain characters, consider using full-width characters instead.  
> The `_intro_.txt` file contains the attributes of the blueprint book. FactorioBluePrintToolkit can automatically add the attributes to the `_intro_.txt` file. If you want to make direct changes, ensure there are no errors.

4. Use [FactorioBluePrintToolkit](https://github.com/Factorio-Resources/FactorioBluePrintToolkit/) or delete the Git-related part in the `update.bat` file to test packaging the blueprints and ensure successful import in the game.  
5. Push the changes to your fork.  
6. Submit a pull request to the main repository (include a description of your changes).
